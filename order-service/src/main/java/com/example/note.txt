Implementation Tips
DTOs: Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to encapsulate the data for creating or updating orders.
Exception Handling: Implement custom exception handling to manage errors gracefully (e.g., order not found, invalid input).
Testing: Write integration tests to ensure the functionality works as expected.
Security: Implement JWT-based authentication to secure order-related endpoints.
